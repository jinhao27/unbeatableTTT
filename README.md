This is a program that turns a regular computer tic tac toe player into an unbeatable one. The AI computer player will never lose; it will either win or it will tie, but it will never lose.

## Motivations
The first time I heard about game theory as something that could be studied at a higher level (i.e. university) in Crazy Rich Asians, I've always been interested in thinking about how some game theories apply to real life situations. Mix that with the beginnings of my interests in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and you have my motivations for making this.
